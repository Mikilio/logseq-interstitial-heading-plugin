# Interstitial journaling helper

> Interstitial journaling is a productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine. To my knowledge, itâ€™s the simplest way to combine note-taking, tasks, and time tracking in one unique workflow. -- [Interstitial journaling: combining notes, to-do & time tracking - Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling)

This plugin makes it *just* a tiny bit easier. Two shortcuts that fill in the time, *and* add the correct Markdown to make it look nice.

## Installation

### Preparation

- Click the 3 dots in the righthand corner and go to Settings.
- Go to **Advanced** and enable **Developer mode**.
- Restart the application.
- Click 3 dots and go to Plugins (or `Esc t p`).

### (Not yet available) Install plugins from Marketplace (recommended) 

- Click Marketplace button and then click Plugins.
- Find the plugin and click Install.

### Install plugins manually

- Download released version assets from Github.
- Unzip it.
- Click Load unpacked plugin, and select destination directory to the unziped folder.

## Usage

- Use `Ctrl-t` to insert a timestamp in the current block/line.
- Use `Ctrl-Shift-t` to insert a timestamped heading in the current block/line.

In the settings you can reverse this, so the default `Ctrl-t` becomes a timestamed heading.

## Configuration

Under settings you can chnage the level of the heading, it defaults to 3 (`### HH:MM <optional title>`)
